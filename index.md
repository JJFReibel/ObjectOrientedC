## Welcome to the project

You can visit the [repo](https://github.com/JJFReibel/ObjectOrientedC) to view or fork the code.

This project was created to show how to use or emulate OOP in pure C. The definiton of OOP is vague, as the name suggests that it is merely programming using objects as a significant feature. A more strict definition insists on having data structures with member functions. Depending on your definition, this project, and many other projects in my repos, either demonstrate or emulate OOP, also known as object oriented programming. Other projects in the repos are in the aming scheme of ObjectOriented_, where the underscore is replaced with either a programming language or other relevant technology. Many widely used languages are included, as well as some more obscure ones.

### Guide

This is not meant to make anyone an expert programmer, but merely a way to introduce programmers to other languages. Some languages have docs that may be difficult to compile into something coherent for the programmer, while others have barely any accessible docs at all. These projects are meant to be a crash course or survey into languages using OOP. Other important things to study are listed below.

Important things to study

# Keywords
# Data types
# Control (loops and such)
# Mechanics (references, reflection, serialization, etc.)
# ...

```

If you are already an expert programmer, this is meant to try to help learn a new language. Good luck!
Please visit my other repos, which contain code in several dozen languages, networking/system scripts, APIs, web programming, and more, including new technologies.
